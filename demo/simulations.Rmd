Decisions to take about the plan of simulations:

* Define and list all configurations which we want to simulate. Some suggestions: 
    + 2 latent factors without known design matrix (PCA case)
    + Should we consider more than 2 factors? Do we have a solution to choose the nb of factors?
    + Case of different library sizes ? Our way to normalize versus Deseq?
    + Any others?

* Number of datasets to simulate for each configuration. Suggestion: 
    + 50 datasets

* Number of genes, number of cells : 
    + reasonable values? 
    + one or several configuration per simulated case?

* Zero inflation
    + Should we consider the case of no zero inflation?
    + Which configurations of zero inflation we consider?
        + Several proportions of zeros: which ones?
    
* Define a list of methods to compare with :
    + ZIFA
    + PCA
    + Weighted PCA
    + Any others ?

* Define criteria of comparison :
    + General measures of quality of dimension reduction ? (without notion of clusters)
    + Dimension reduction + clustering. Suggestions:
        + For each method, do a dimension reduction followed by k-means, including the choice of number of                 clusters.
            1. Case of simulation with known true partition: compare Rand indices of similarity
            2. General statistics on quality of clustering. Which ones?
                + Silhouette averaged over all observations ( any better solution using silhouette? )
